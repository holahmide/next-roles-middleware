Hello there, I hope you are doing welll,  In this post I'll share with you how to implement a very scalable role based authorization.

So we will be doing this in five easy steps

## 1. Installing required libraries
This post is based on nextj and typescript so you will need to install nextjs, but we will use a starter template. Copy the following to your terminal.
```terminal
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```
Or
```terminal
yarn create next-app --typescript
```

After a couple of minutes the installation should be done.
